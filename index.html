  <p><strong>Hi,Myself Vijay!</strong></p>
  <p>You can call me ABD too. Most of the people know me by this name, not by face.  I'm a student at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, currently pursuing Btech in the civil engineering department. It was my dream to study at IIT, and now it's fulfilled. I got here many things like friends an environment where we can explore every field you are interested in. It's a place we learn more from students rather than academics. </p>
